while (boolean) {
  <body>
}
*if boolean is true, runs body until the boolean is false

for (<initializeVariables>; <boolean>; <increment/variableUpdate>) {
  <body>
}
*initializes variables (requires type specifications)
*while boolean is true, runs body until false
*after each time the body is run, the increment/variable update is applied

when a loop hits a break; statement, the loop is automatically terminated
