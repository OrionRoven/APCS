Math methods:

Math.sqrt(2) represents √2
Math.sin(angle) represents sin(angle)
Math.PI represents π
Math.E represents Euler's number
Math.round(x) rounds x and converts it to a long (like an int but can store more values)
Math.pow(x,y) raises x to the power of y

public static void printTwice(String s) takes input String s (must specify variable type)
methods can take multiple comma seperated parameters, but each of their types must still be specified
when invoking a method (calling it in a different method), you don't have to specify the types of the parameters, but you have to comma seperate them
