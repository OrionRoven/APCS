ping() prints "." and makes a new line
  the outpout is . and then a new line
baffle() prints "wug" and invokes ping()
  the output is wug. and then a new line
zoop() invokes baffle(), prints "You wugga " and then invokes baffle() again
  the output is:
  wug.
  You wugga wug.
the main method prints "No, I ", invokes zoop(), prints "I ", then invokes baffle()
  the output is:
  No, I wug.
  You wugga wug.
  I wug.

The first time ping() is invoked the state of the program is:
  No, I wug.
  (this is after ping() runs and there is a new line after)

If we invoke baffle() at the end of the ping() method, we we will it will return:
  No, I wug.
  wug.
  wug.
  and keeps going
  then it gats a StackOverflowError, because the output it too big for java to handle
