Relational operators are used for if statements
  x==y (x equal y), x!=y (x does not equal y), x>y (x is greater than y) x<=y (x is less than or equal to y)
  outputs are true or false (boolean values)
  can't compare strings and ints (5=='5')
Logical operators
  && means and
  || means or
  ! means not

if (<conditonal>) {
  //do stuff
} else if (<conditional>) {
  //do stuff
} else {
  //do stuff
}

boolean value stores something that is true or false:
boolean iAmCool = true;
return; ends a method prematurely
a method that invokes itself is called recursive
a StackOverflow error happens when a recursive function never returns and the stack overflows
