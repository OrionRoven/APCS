DISCO:

When a thinker receives 2 sorted decks, they must perform the sort algorithm discussed in class (see thinker firmware)

QCC:

Is it necessary to pass 1 card to 2 different thinkeren just to have it passed back?


Thinker Firmware:

* If you an unsorted deck of length > 2, split it and pass it to 2 other thinkeren
* If you receive a deck of length 1, return it to the thinker that gave it to you
* If you receive a deck of length 2, sort it then return it to the thinker that gave it to you
* If a thinker recieves 2 sorted decks, they must look at the first card of each deck and put the lower card in a new (sorted) deck and repeat until fully sorted
