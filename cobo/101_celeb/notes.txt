DISCO:
* In the setupPanel() method in the StarPanel class it was helpful to add all of
 the instance variable and remove the ones that gave us errors

QCC:
*

Activity1:
1. We might need a Celebrity class which represents a single celebrity, and a CelebrityGame class for running the game.
We could also create subclasses of Celebrity for more specific types, such as artists or actors.\
2. For the Game class, we would need an ArrayList of Celebrities (the hat in the actual game) and a current Celebrity.
3. It would likely have a play behavior which would run all the functionality. This would require a behavior that allows the user to enter in Celebrity info,
and a method that would show the clue to the user and accept guesses. We would need some way to processing these guesses.
4. Most of these previously listed behaviors might become methods. However, some methods are only run once, such as allowing user entry, so we could directly incorporate those into the methods that call them.
5. Play should do the following:
Call the method that allows the user to add the list of Celebrities
Pick a random celebrity and start a timer
Accept user input and process the guesses
Check if there are any more celebrities left and potentially give the user a new one
6. A person has a name, address, place of work, etc. The address is itself an object which has multiple fields.
